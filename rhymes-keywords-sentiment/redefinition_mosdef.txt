What, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad drags
So I run through 'em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick to Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, entering millennium
My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinia, sure to hold the Gideon
Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim
Born inside the winter wind, day after December ten
These simpletons they mentioned in the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon, the Danish rings by Entenmann's
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
Gentlemen you got a tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddling, making em WOOP
Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot Apache red who burn down your chief teepee
You see me?
